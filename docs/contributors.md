## Branch Management Policy

### Feature Branches

When working on a new feature, create a branch named `feature/issue-123`, where `issue-123` corresponds to the issue or feature you are addressing.

Example: `feature/add-login-functionality`

### Bug Fix Branches

For bug fixes, create a branch named `bugfix/issue-456`, where `issue-456` is the related issue number.

Example: `bugfix/fix-error-logging-issue`

### Personal Branches

If you are working on a personal improvement or experiment, prefix your branch with your username: `username/feature/issue-789`.

Example: `john-doe/feature/new-dashboard`

## Merging Branches

- Branches can be merged into the `main` branch after undergoing a thorough review.
- Pull requests must receive approval from at least one team member.
- Ensure that your code is well-documented and adheres to our coding standards.

## Commit Messages

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) conventions for your commit messages.
- Write clear and concise messages that explain the purpose of the commit.

## Code Conventions

- Adhere to [the PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary.
- Write meaningful variable and function names.

## Release Policy

- Releases follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Create a release branch for each major release: `release/v1.0.0`.
- After a release branch is created, only bug fixes should be merged into it.
- New features and non-critical changes should be targeted for the next major release.
